**PeopleFlow** is an AI-based system that detects and counts people entering and exiting a space using **OpenCV** and **Deep Learning**. It utilizes object detection models to track movement across a defined zone, making it useful for **crowd monitoring, security, and smart analytics**.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ **Real-time Person Detection** – Identifies people with bounding boxes  
✅ **Entry & Exit Counting** – Tracks individuals crossing the defined zones  
✅ **Live Video Processing** – Works with both recorded and live camera feeds  
✅ **Automated Data Logging** – Stores counts for further analysis  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)  
- **Deep Learning (SSD MobileNet / YOLO)**  
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)  

## 📌 How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prajesdas/PeopleFlow.git
   cd PeopleFlow
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
   ```  
3. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python people_counter.py
   ```
